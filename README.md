## Exploring Hass Avocado Market Trends: A Data-Driven Analysis of Sales and Pricing (2015-2023)

### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the sales and pricing trends of Hass avocados in the United States between 2015 and 2023. It explores how factors such as seasonality, regional differences, and economic conditions impact avocado prices and sales volumes. The insights gathered from this analysis can help stakeholders—producers, retailers, and consumers—make more informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, inventory management, and market expansion.

### Goals of the Project:
Trend Analysis: Examining historical trends in avocado prices and sales.
Regional Comparison: Understanding the impact of local factors on market dynamics.
Predictive Modeling: Forecasting future prices and sales.
Impact Assessment: Evaluating external factors affecting market conditions.
